This bot is very much still in barebones.

Current invite link for bot: [Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=325260725155135488&scope=bot&permissions=3402816)

Noteable things are you need your bot token and you'll need the changes I made to node-albion-api to support deaths and single events.
